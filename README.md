## üóÇÔ∏è Data Description

The dataset includes comprehensive climate model outputs and observational data:

### Data Sources
- **NCEP-NSCv2** ensemble members
- **NASA-GMAO** ensemble members
- **Ground truth data**: precipitation and 2-meter temperature
- **Observational data**: sea level pressure (slp), relative humidity (rhum), 500mb geopotential height (hgt500)
- **Principal components** of sea surface temperatures (SSTs)

### Additional Files
- US mask for regional analysis
- Observational climatology
- Model climatology
- 33rd and 66th percentile threshold values

### Data Structure
All data has been preprocessed and regridded to ensure consistency across ensemble members, ground truth, and climate variables.

```
train_val/     # Training and validation data
test/          # Test data
```

**Data Dimensions**: `(t, 64, 128)` where:
- Training/validation: `t = 312`
- NCEP test data: `t = 117`
- NASA test data: `t = 85`

### Data Access

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Python 3.3 or higher
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- [Segmentation Models PyTorch (smp)](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch)


It can be installed as
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

### Data Utilities
Use `utils_data.py` for data loading and preprocessing functions.

### Example Notebooks

We provide several Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different modeling approaches:

#### 1. Regression and Tercile Classification
- **[Regression Baselines + Temperature Tercile Classification](regression&tercile_classification/regression_baselines_RF_tercile_tmp.ipynb)**
  - Random Forest regression with tercile classification for temperature
  
- **[U-Net Regression + Temperature Tercile Classification](regression&tercile_classification/regression_UNET_tercile_tmp.ipynb)**
  - Deep learning approach using U-Net architecture

#### 2. Advanced Modeling Techniques
- **[Model Stacking](regression&tercile_classification/stacking_models.ipynb)**
  - Ensemble methods combining multiple model predictions
  
- **[Precipitation Tercile Classification](regression&tercile_classification/tercile_classification_precip.ipynb)**
  - Categorical forecasting for precipitation events


## üî¨ Methodology

Our approach goes beyond simple ensemble averaging by:
1. Leveraging individual ensemble members rather than just ensemble means
2. Using deep learning to capture spatial patterns and relationships
3. Implementing tercile-based classification for categorical forecasting
4. Combining multiple models through stacking techniques

## üìà Results

The methods demonstrated in this repository show improved subseasonal forecasting performance compared to traditional ensemble averaging, particularly for extreme weather events and spatial pattern prediction.
